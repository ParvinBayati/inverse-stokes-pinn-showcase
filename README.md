# Physics-Informed Neural Network for Inverse Stokes Flow

## Overview

This repository documents a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) framework developed for solving inverse problems governed by the incompressible Stokes equations.

The framework combines sparse observational data with governing physical laws to reconstruct unknown flow quantities while enforcing consistency with the underlying fluid dynamics.

The methodology is applicable to a variety of low-Reynolds-number flow problems, including microfluidics, soft matter systems, active matter, and interfacial hydrodynamics.

## Governing Equations

The model is based on the incompressible Stokes equations

$$
-\nabla p + \mu \nabla^2 \mathbf{u} = \mathbf{0}
$$

$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} = 0
$$

where

* $\mathbf{u}$ denotes the velocity field,
* $p$ denotes the pressure field,
* $\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity.

## PINN Formulation

A neural network is trained to approximate the unknown solution fields.

The loss function combines:

* Data mismatch loss
* PDE residual loss
* Boundary condition loss

$$\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{Phys} + \lambda_{data} \mathcal{L}_{data}$$

where

$$\mathcal{L}_{Phys} = \mathcal{L}_{PDE} + \mathcal{L}_{BC} + \mathcal{L}_{wall}$$

Automatic differentiation is used to evaluate the derivatives appearing in the governing equations.
